# Homework 15 - D3 and Leaflet

## Description

This app retrieves a set of earthquake data from a US Geological Survey server and uses it to create a map of earthquake location, depth, and magnitude. Each earthquake has its own circle, with popup description.

### Notes

I decided to change the depth color scaling based on the depths present in the dataset. At the end of the day, it would probably have made just as much sense to hardcode some numbers, but by the time I realized that, I was already done with the implementation.

### Source

No code was copied from external sources.
